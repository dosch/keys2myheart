        <p>Before you get started with the bracelet, you'll need a basic understanding of how PGP works. You can start at our <a href="what_is_pgp.html"> our PGP page</a> but make sure you read <a href="https://sdd.eff.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> this if you speak English</a> or <a href="https://toolbox.bof.nl/overzicht/categorie/e-mail/"> dit als je liever Nederlands leest.</a> It will take approximately 30 to 60 minutes of your time.</p>

        <h2>Congrats with your secret Key2Myheart identity!</h2>
    
    <p>Thanks for taking part in <strong>The Key to my Heart</strong>! and welcome to the world of encrypted email, we hope that this is your first step towards learning how to keep your data to yourself.</p>

<p>We must warn you though of a few things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>This key has been generated securely to the best of our capability.</li>
	<li>The computer used to generate this key, shredded the key immediately after generating it. We do not keep copies of your private key.</li>
	<li>A few seconds of your heartbeat sound have been recorded, but the amount of data is not enough to identify you.</li>
	<li>For usability reasons the key isn&#39;t password protected, but you can add a password any time you like.</li>
	<li>To use your key in a more secure way we recommend that you, first of all, protect the key with a password.</li>
	<li>You should consider this key as low security.</li>
	<li>If you are a journalist or activist and need to protect your sources, you may use this key to learn more about encrypted email, but we strongly suggest to not use this key for sensitive communications. Practice, learn more about encrypting your email and when you feel confident generate a new key for yourself.</li>
	<li>If you want to encrypt your email so that the Google&#39;s and the Facebook&#39;s of this world cannot target advertisements at you however, this key is more than enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>So you got your new digital identity from our installation but now what? How do you use this thing?</p>
<h2>If you are on a Mac computer</h2>

	<li>Plug the USB bracelet into your computer</li>
