        <h1>What is this PGP thing anyway?</h1>
	
	<p>PGP is a way to protect your email communications from being read by anyone except their intended recipients. It can protect against companies, governments, or criminals spying on your Internet connection, and, to a lesser extent, it can save your email from being read if the computer on which they are stored is stolen or broken into. </p>

<p>It can also be used to prove that an email came from a particular person, instead of being a fake message sent by another sender (it is otherwise very easy for email to be fabricated). Both of these are important defenses if you're being targeted for surveillance or misinformation.</p>

<p>That is why you are reading this :-)</p>

<h2>Ok, cool. How do I start?</h2>
<p>To use PGP, you will need to install some extra software that will work with your current email program. You can then use the private key generated at the Key2MyHeart installation. This private key is what you will use to decrypt emails sent to you, and to digitally sign emails that you send to show they truly came from you. Finally, you'll learn how to distribute your public keyâ€”a small chunk of information that others will need to know before they can send you encrypted mail, and that they can use to verify emails you send.</p>

<h2>Continue learning</h2>

<p>If you are interested in keeping your data to yourself and how to incorporate healthy data practices into your computer routine, you can use the following list of online resources to learn more:</p>

<h2>Go out and meet others</h2>

<p>Bits of Freedom and a great network of volunteers do regular get-togethers where anybody with any age or background can go a learn more about how to protect their data. These events normally take place in a public library near you. If you want to learn more the friendly volunteers of the <a href="https://privacycafe.nl/">PrivacyCafes</a> will help you further.</p>
