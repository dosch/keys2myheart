        <h1>What is PGP?</h1>
	
	<p>PGP is a way to protect your email communications from being read by anyone except their intended recipients. It can protect against companies, governments, or criminals spying on your Internet connection, and, to a lesser extent, it can save your email from being read if the computer on which they are stored is stolen or broken into. </p>

<p>It can also be used to prove that an email came from a particular person, instead of being a fake message sent by another sender (it is otherwise very easy for email to be fabricated). Both of these are important defenses if you're being targeted for surveillance or misinformation.</p>

<p>That is why you are reading this :-)</p>

<h2>Ok, cool. How do I start?</h2>
<p>To use PGP, you will need to install some extra software that will work with your current email program. You can then use the private key generated at the Key2MyHeart installation. This private key is what you will use to decrypt emails sent to you, and to digitally sign emails that you send to show they truly came from you. Finally, you'll learn how to distribute your public keyâ€”a small chunk of information that others will need to know before they can send you encrypted mail, and that they can use to verify emails you send.</p>
